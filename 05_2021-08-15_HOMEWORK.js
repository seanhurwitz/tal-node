SPEC
-- I want to go for a RUN! But I want to know if I CAN!
-- What would prevent me from running?
--- I usually go in the morning, so if it's later than 10AM I won't go.
---- BUT: if it's winter I WILL go after 10AM, because it doesn't get so hot in the afternoon.
--- I won't go if it's raining.
--- I won't go if I'm feeling sick.

Challenge: build an IF statement that will determine if I will go for a run based on variables:
-isItMorning
-isItWinter
-isItRaining
-amIHealthy

Try different values for each variable and try console log each combination.
BONUS: use javascript's new Date() to get the current hours for isItMorning.

Use if/Else or a singular IF statement using && and ||

Hatzlocha!
